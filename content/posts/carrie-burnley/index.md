Venable Elementary School was opened in 1925 in what is now the Venable neighborhood of Charlottesville, Virginia, as the primary school for white students living on the west side of the city. The school's namesake, Col. Charles S. Venable, has since fallen into obscurity, so that even those parents with students in the school would be hard-pressed to come up with his name or why the school was named for him.

This is the somewhat-obscured description on the Charlottesville City Schools website:

> The school was named for Colonel Charles Scott Venable, who was a Civil War soldier, professor of mathematics at the University of Virginia and author of arithmetic books for children.
