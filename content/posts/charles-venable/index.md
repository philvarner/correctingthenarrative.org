## Introduction

-> new photo

Venable Elementary School was opened in 1925 in what is now the Venable neighborhood of Charlottesville, Virginia, as the primary school for white students living on the west side of the city. It followed the opening of McGuffey Primary School (now the McGuffey Arts Center) ten years prior in 1916. If asked today, most people, even those parents with students in the school, probably couldn't tell you who it was named for.  Many might assume that it's named for the neighborhood around it, rather than the reverse, or that it's a form of the adjective "venerable".  

This is the (somewhat disguised) description on the Charlottesville City Schools website:

> The school was named for Colonel Charles Scott Venable, who was a Civil War soldier, professor of mathematics at the University of Virginia and author of arithmetic books for children.  
> [About Venable Elementary School](http://charlottesvilleschools.org/venable/us), 

He wasn't just "a" Civil War soldier. He played an instrumental role in the Confederate army, as an aide-de-camp, literally beside ["the most heroic and saintly of all Confederates"](https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/lost_cause_the#its1) (at least by white Southerners), Robert E. Lee.  He then parlayed this close association with Lee, including a personal letter of recommendation from him, into a professorship at UVa.  Throughout his life, he supported slavery, promoted [The Lost Cause](https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/lost_cause_the) myth that sought to recast the Civil War as something other than primarily to preserve slavery, and made explicitly clear his racist and white supremacist beliefs.

>[Venable] derided the idea of giving freedmen the vote, expressing thanks that Virginia had escaped the ‘black dominion’ of military Reconstruction, and derided the idea of blacks attending the University of South Carolina as **‘the Fetish of abolitionists.’** Finally, he summarized Reconstruction itself as **‘the cruel crotchets of a sentimental philanthropy.’**

## Early Life 

[Charles S. Venable](https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Venable_Charles_S_1827-1900) was born in Farmville, Virginia in 1827 into a prominent family.  His family and ancestors owned numerous large plantations in Virginia that primarily relied on enslaved labor.  Among those relatives of the Venable name, there are his:

* son, [Francis P. Venable](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Venable-362), University of Virginia in 1876, REWRITE In 1900, on the resignation of President Edwin Anderson Alderman, who moved to the same post at Tulane University, Venable was elected president of The University of North Carolina.
* father, [Nathaniel E. Venable](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Venable-9), captain in a militia during the War of 1812
* grandfather, [Col. Samuel Woodson Venable Sr.](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Venable-3), an officer in Captain Watkins' Dragoons, under Major-General Henry "Light-Horse Harry" Lee III (father of Robert E. Lee) during the Revolutionary War
* great-grandfather, [Colonel Nathaniel E Venable I](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Venable-50) - Revolutionary War officer
* great-great-grandfather, [Captain Abraham Venable II](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Venable-46) - captain in a colonial militia
* great-great-great-grandfather, [Abraham Venable I](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Venable-45) - a surgeon in the first regiment of British troops sent to Jamestown, under Sir John Harvie

Venable first received an AB degree at Hampden-Sydney College, of which his great-grandfather was a founder, then matriculated from the University of Virginia in 1845. He proceeded to teach at Hampden-Sydney College, the University of Georgia, and the University of South Carolina before joining the Confederate cause. 

## War Years

In 1858, three years before the start of the Civil War, Venable gave a speech to UVA alumni in which he defends the South and slavery. 

In 1861, he was a professor at South Carolina College (now University of South Carolina).  He joined the Congaree Rifles militia and encouraged his students leave college and join Confederate military units. As part of this militia, he was present in 1861 at the Battle of Fort Sumter, which began the Civil War.  Venable soon became an officer in the newly-formed Confederate States Army, then served as aide-de-camp in the small personal staff of Gen. Robert E. Lee from 1862 until surrender in 1865. From then on he styled himself with the honorific "Colonel," instead of "Professor" or "Doctor."

Primarily because of his association with Lee, including a personal letter of recommendation from him, Venable was offered a position as a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Virginia. This was also an intentional slight to the Federal "occupiers" then in control of the state. Venable taught at UVA for the next 30 years, and served as Chairman of the Faculty for several years during that time. He wrote a number of mathematics textbooks which were adopted in Virginia schools and served on the Charlottesville School Board for six years.

After the Civil War, as secretary of the Association of the Army of Northern Virginia, Venable was an ["important voice among those promoting the Lost Cause interpretation of the Civil War,"](https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Venable_Charles_S_1827-1900) which ["sought to discount the importance of slavery and emphasize the valor of Confederate soldiers."](https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Venable_Charles_S_1827-1900) The Lost Cause also gave rise to the era of racial terror known as Jim Crow, the miseducation of generations, and the perpetuation of the myth of white racial supremacy.

Selections about Charles Venable:

“Whiling away long hours conversing with States Rights Gist, James and Mary Chesnut, and other notables, Venable often expressed both his disgust at the northerners who were waging war against ‘Christian’ slavery and those who sought commissions in the Confederate army behind the lines.” -- Mary Chesnut’s Civil War 

“[By 1867], he proposed a curriculum change to make the mathematics program more flexible, and staunchly opposed any attempt to open the university [of Virginia] to black students” -- Memoir by F. P. Venable, Barbour Family Papers, and Charles S. Venable Papers

“Similarly, although Charles Venable felt the necessity of preserving heroic memories of the Confederacy, he was too preoccupied with personal and professional matters to participate in most public efforts to promote the ‘Lost Cause.’ He continued to correspond with other former Confederate officers... and joined local historical associations to promote Confederate memory, writing that, ‘I esteem highly the work of such societies in collecting and preserving the materials for local and state histories.’ Because of his Confederate sympathies, Wade Hampton offered him the presidency of the University of South Carolina in 1882.” -- Charles S. Venable Papers

## Venable Elementary School

When Venable Primary School was named in late 1924, the existing, segregated public schools in Charlottesville were Midway School (grades 1-11, white), McGuffey Primary School (grades 1-7, white), and Jefferson Colored School (grades 1-7, Black). Midway was named after Alexander Garrett’s former plantation house, which sat nearby and where he enslaved more than 60 Black people,and Jefferson was named after Thomas Jefferson. McGuffey Primary School was named in 1916 for William Holmes McGuffey, a professor of Philosophy at UVA, who wrote the McGuffey Readers, “the first widely used series of elementary school-level textbooks... [selling] more than 120 million copies... between 1836 and 1960.”

At the October 16, 1924 Charlottesville School Board meeting, the three-man naming committee recommended naming the new school “Venable” by a vote of 2-1, with one of the yes votes coming from Dr. Thomas L. Watson, Professor of Geology at UVA. Both Watson’s father, Fletcher B. Watson, and uncle, Wilbur F. Watson, served in the Virginia 6th Cavalry Regiment, Confederate States Army. As relayed in The Daily Progress the next day, “Mr. Paul G. McIntire spoke in favor of honoring the name and work of Col. Charles S. Venable by naming the new school for him.”

At the Nov. 20, 1924 Charlottesville School Board meeting, the Board voted 7-3 to name the new school “Venable Primary School.”
